    <h1>About this website</h1>
    <p>
      Chances are you came wondering what kind of technologies were involved
      in making this simple personal webpage. Though they are not numerous,
      I do want to properly mention them and thank the developers for their
      work, because they really rock :)

      Scala can be defined by, I quote: "Object-Oriented meets Functional",
      and I think that phrase catches the main idea of that language. It
      runs on a <abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</abbr>, and it has
      everything a Java program can run with (since it can actually run Java code),
      and it bundles an elegant functional syntax which allows you to do everything
      with scarce &mdash; if any &mdash; boilerplate code. All in all, it's a
      language I love to bits, which is why I'm using it to power this website.
      So kudos to <a href="http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/">Martin Odersky</a> and
      his team at <a href="http://www.epfl.ch/">EPFL</a> for designing it :)

      Play is THE framework you want to use if you're doing any web development with
      Scala. Of course, thanks to the very nature of Scala it can also be run with
      Java, and thanks to it using <a href="http://netty.io/">Netty</a> as a web server
      and <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a> to manage its threads,
      it has tremendous performance. And thanks to Scala's syntax, it can run with very
      little code! Not to mention that it's bundled with a powerful and comprehensive API,
      including a great JSON library based on Jackson which makes it very REST-ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      This kind of reasoning is why people at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>
      chose Play as their runtime framework, as many others have! And I personally think
      it's a pleasure to use it.

    <h2><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" class="bs-purple">Bootstrap</a></h2>
    <p>
      Bootstrap is one of the most &mdash; yet again, if not the most &mdash;
      popular CSS frameworks there is. It provides a solid CSS reset and
      normaliser, a very powerful grid system, mobile-oriented design
      patterns and much more!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bootstrap also includes the complete set of
      <a href="http://glyphicons.com/">Glyphicon halflings</a> thanks to their creator
      who made them available for free to Bootstrap users, so thanks!

      Heroku is a hosting service, and it's now powered by Salesforce! They
      have great uptime, a lot of power since they run on Amazon S3s and they
      have a free plan. But what I think is their greatest strength is their
      ability to deploy web apps of any kind without any configuration on the
      developer's side, even if it runs on some weird platform such as Rails,
      Django, Node.js...You name it. Just push your git repository out there
      and boom! A magic second later you can watch your app live on the
      Internets. They also provide a PostGreSQL database by default and a
      <em>fuckton</em> other add-ons &mdash; they really have everything you
      might think of, let alone need.
