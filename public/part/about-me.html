      Hello! I'm a student in computer science who lives in Paris, France.
      As you could guess from what you've just read above, I am currently
      preparing a master's degree in computational linguistics at University of Paris 7,
      and I'm also a student from the class of 2013 at 42. I am currently an intern at Amazon,
      and looking to learn more while working with the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      I originally graduated from high school in humanities, and kept
      convincing myself that writing code would only be a hobby...until I
      tried coding in an academic context &mdash; that would be in my
      third year in college &mdash; and faced the obvious: I wanted to be
      a developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The languages I've used so far are various, but at 42 I'm mainly using <strong>C</strong>
      and <strong>C++</strong>. As for the university, I'm mainly using <strong>Java</strong> and
      <strong>Python</strong>, which led me to experiment several web frameworks, including
      <strong>Symfony2</strong> and <strong>Django</strong>. But the one I'm using to power
      the page you are reading is <strong>Play 2</strong>, which I'll be covering in more details
      <a href="#/about/me">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My true specialty is <strong>computational linguistics</strong>, which consists in building solutions to
      make people communicate with machines using natural language. This field implies working
      mainly with <strong>machine learning</strong>-based solutions, and constantly defying
      the state of the art by pushing beyond what we know.
