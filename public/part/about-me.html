      Hello! I'm a student in computer science who lives in Paris, France.
      As you could guess from what you've just read above, I am currently
      preparing a master's degree in computational linguistics at University of Paris-7,
      and I'm also a student from the class of 2013 at 42. For the second semester of 2014,
      I work as an intern web developer at <a href="http://www.canalplus.fr/">CANAL+</a>,
      and I am currently looking for an internship from march to august 2015.
    </p>
    <p>
      I originally graduated from high school in humanities, and kept
      convincing myself that writing code would only be a hobby...until I
      actually tried coding in an academic context &mdash; that would be in my
      third year in college &mdash; and faced the obvious: I wanted to be
      a developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The languages I've used so far are various, but at 42 I'm mainly using <strong>C</strong>
      and <strong>C++</strong>. As for the university, I'm mainly using <strong>Java</strong> and
      <strong>Python</strong>, which led me to experiment several web frameworks, including
      <strong>Symfony2</strong> and <strong>Django</strong>. But the one I'm using to power
      the page you are reading is <strong>Play 2</strong>, which I'll be covering in more details
      <a href="#/about/me">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My main coding machine is a Macbook Pro, and as such most of my developing is done
      on <strong>OS X</strong>. I also work with <strong>Ubuntu</strong> on a regular
      basis and I tend to deploy servers on <strong>Debian</strong>. I also tried a couple
      other distributions such as <strong>Fedora</strong> and <strong>OpenSuSE</strong>,
      but I guess when you grow up in the Debian universe, it's kinda hard to get rid
      of habits :)
    </p>
    <p>
      And mind you, I do have hobbies besides coding! I watch anime, I run
      when I have time to &mdash; which rarely happens when you attend
      two schools at the same time &mdash; and I play the piano. So maybe
      one day, when I get the skill and the courage to do it, I might upload
      something on YouTube to that regard. Stay tuned :)
    </p>
